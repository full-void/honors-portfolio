                                Mindfulness is a state of mind: one in which you have ‘unadulterated’ attention. My favorite one is Samatha Meditation along with interludes of techniques focusing Compassion, Empathetic Joy, Equanimity, Love, and so on. <br><br>
                                Now, the later stages of the meditation are designed to bring out the hard parts on you (think ‘shadow’ from Jungian psychology) and allow you to accept them and gain freedom. Without a proper guidance, I simply tried to force my way through. As you may have guessed it did not turn out to be pretty. <br><br>
                                I have no idea what I did, but I doomed myself to face things that I could not handle. Looking back, all I could say that it was a wild ride. I went from a normal to cold hearted to childishly emotional to depressed idiot to (finally) a happy guy with a clearer perspective on things. <br><br>
                                The experience overturned my world views and shattered my reality. I asked myself some very important and deeply personal and influential questions. With a clear perspective, I can now understand a lot more things that were simply alien to me. Not only that but my understandings of matters that I presumed ‘I knew’ are now much more lucid. <br><br>
                                Most importantly, however, I have realized the meaning of true happiness: one that believes in contentment and peace rather than pursuit of pleasure or power. I also eliminated many of my biases that I (much to my shock) found out.  <br><br>
                                To conclude, I would like to say that meditation has been a significant, if not the most important, experience in my life. It was extremely both transformative and informative and would continue to be so.

            <h4>Novel Writing</h4>
            <p class="text-black-50 f6 mb-0">
                Novel writing was one of the most frustrating, challenging, yet rewarding experiences of my life. First of all, me and my brother (or co-writer) had little experience. Hence, we both devoured books on writing, ones covering a broad range of topics like characters, setting, philosophy, psychology, grammar.<br> <br>
                We also spent hours discussing the plot. Discussions sometimes evolved into pointless arguments. With time, we found various strategies as a counter. Our favorite was to put it away for a while. This allowed emotions to cool down and biases to momentarily break. We would then point out the pros and cons one-by-one. Finally, we made a conscious effort to be more understanding and open. This solved our fights and we came up with something that satisfied both of us. <br> <br>
                Now, I would like to point out that the whole experience turned out to be more that just a pleasurable hobby. It made both of us grow tremendously. As I mentioned before, we ticked off a lot of reading materials from our checklist. Some of those included philosophy and psychology which would fundamentally change our views and reality for rest of our lives. We asked and answered some very important questions about life, morality, and so on; the answers of whom impacted not only our characters behaviors but also our own. We have other directly inquired upon them or shown them via situations and plot in the novel; and also keep on doing ourselves in real life.<br> <br>
                Speaking of characters, their creation and growth opened our eyes to complexity of human psyche. From our readings, we found out that human(s) can be exceedingly noble and evil--sometimes even both. It's fascinating how varied can people behaviors be. Whilst there is some order, it is very general at best. After all, even the vilest of villains have clear and understandable motives. They just have gone through some experiences and have come to unpleasant conclusions. Thus their motivations are as valid and reasonable as yours, mine, and Mother Teresa’s. Still, it does NOT excuse them from their responsibilities; they must be punished. But it leaves us with a deeper understanding and a cautionary tale. This was a very enlightening moment, and we have tried our best to capture it in the novel. Fighting our urges to just make the villain a monster, we portray our antagonists with valid motivations—as twisted as they may be. After all, we believe that it adds a touch of realism.<br> <br>
                As you may have found out, we did our best to make our novel not only entertaining but also provoking deep thought. There are both heartbreaking and heartwarming moments. It took a lot of time from us, but we have zero regrets. It was a great, fun, and transformative experience for us.

                <h4 class="text-white">Bearcats Lead Tutoring</h4>
                <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">
                    Bearcats Lead Tutoring was a very bright experience for me. After all, it meant not only tutoring children but also leading a team of tutors. Both of those activities build skills that I am grateful for.<br> <br>
                    Helping children was harder than I expected. I have a little sister at home, so I though it would be easy. Boy I was wrong. First of all being the lack of trust and bond. I have a very strong bond with my sis, since I was there for her from the very beginning. Although rebellious and snarky, she listens to me when it’s important. Something I took for granted. It was frustrating to get the kids in line and making sure they do the right thing. Furthermore, I couldn’t really yell or threaten them either. Although a last resort for dealing with my little sister, it is sometimes helpful when absolutely nothing gets across. Still, it was a very joyous and heartwarming time. After all, helping children with education and making them smile is always a good feeling.<br> <br>
                    Being the leader of the tutor was also an interesting experience. I often had facilitate communication between the tutors and the managers (both at UC and the school). Last minute changes were not pleasant to deal with—although they did improve my communication skills. I also had my first experience with fairly paperwork: checking the hours put in, the waivers and what not.<br> <br>
                    In conclusion, it was a very uplifting and informative event.
