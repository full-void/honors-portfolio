                <p class="text-white-50">
                    I can confidently say that the year 2020 – 2021 is one of the most important ones in my life. Although not a lot of things happened, the small number of things that did are going to be incredibly important moving forward. <br><br>
                    The biggest thing that happened was solidification of my personal identity and future path. Previously, I only had vague insights into who ‘I’ truly was and what should the future be. With lots of contemplation, mental simulations, and meditation, I now have a full grasp on what they all need to be. I’m incredibly thankful for that. Previously, there was some uncertainty on what I should do, what I should have done and a lot of confusion on what I wanted too. But now I have a clear direction on things. And this direction is going to guide my life from now on and provide me with satisfactory happiness and peace.<br><br>
                    On a similar note, I also went back home in the Spring semester due to COVID-19 and spent some time with my family. This allowed me to ‘re-connect’ to a portion of myself that had been obscured with other things. On my quest to have a meaningful life in which I would give back to society and achieve personal success, I had somewhat neglected the most important things: my relationships and loved ones. That realization was a powerful one and was one of the ‘final strokes’ in my identity. <br><br>
                    On the standpoint of career, I also realized that I wanted to go in the field of data science. I was able to discover how it can be used to transform lives and incredibly important and rewarding it is. Taking bits and pieces of raw information and using them in novel ways to solve complex problems is incredibly mind-blowing. Furthermore, data science tools can be used in everyday life to make both more informed decisions and have a better sense of the world.  <br><br>
                    For future, I would keep on continuing with the goals I found. On a professional standpoint, I would continue to improve myself on data science. For personal life, I would try to improve my relationships and continue meditation. With the university opening in fall, I would also like to connect with lots of people. This would not only give me a broader perspective on things and issues I can work upon, but also aid me with my social skills and life. <br><br>

                <h2 class="text-white mb-4">2019 - 2020</h2>
                <p class="text-white-50">
                    I would like to say that my time of year 2019 – 2020 would be one of the most memorable ones. A plethora of events transpired that had a major impact. My job at SHP gave me some crucial insights into importance and subletites of company’s culture; since I had enough experience to contrast different ones. This undoubtedly gave me some very important lessons that I’m convinced would tremendously shape my behaviors and actions for future.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    The coronavirus pandemic also taught me important lessons. The most important one being the necessity keep a calm head. I have known people belonging to both end of the spectrum: the panicked ones and the callous ones. Whilst there were some people who took it too far, there were some who outright dismissed it. The right approach is somewhere in the middle. Finally, the whole experience of the lockdown was a fresh one. As an introvert, I was somewhat thankful. However, it also robbed me of important social interactions. In the end, it simply worked out as more time for introspection and meditation. Perhaps not ideal, but not a bad deal at all.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Finally, it has been one in which I have undergone and immense transformation. This would honestly seem repetitive, but meditation truly bore me fruit in this year. Whilst I don’t dare say that this transformation has finished, as there are still a lot of changes undergoing. Still, I can confidently proclaim that my core values have sufficiently changed. I now have a higher understanding of not only my current status, but also my future path. Concepts that used to elude me before are now in my grasp. Most importantly, I can now truly see the outline of my actual calling: one which will give me genuine, satisfactory peace and contentment. Needless to say, I’m excited about what the future and looking forward to the changes.
